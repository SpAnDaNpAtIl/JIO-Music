## JIO fixed this issue so you can no longer send queries to these links. I am still keeping this repository if you want to check how we accessed jio music few months back.


### JIO-Music
##### Music Streaming Player :)


Library requirements for this player are requests, json, vlc.

I assume that requests and json will already be installed in your python environment or you can use pip command to install them.

For installing VLC library just enter the following command

``` pip install python-vlc```


Further after running python script, type your song name to get related searches of it.
> NOTE: First search result is generally the best one which is matched with your inserted query. But if it does not matches your desired song, just enter any integer other than 1 to get another result similar to it.

I will be adding more song qualities later. Currently only 3 qualitites i.e. HD, good and low are added.
